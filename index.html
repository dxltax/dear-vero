    <h1>To Vero</h1>
    <p>
      I’m sorry this page has to greet you like this.  
      Today was supposed to be warm, maybe even sweet.  
      But I can’t pretend that everything’s fine when my heart feels otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s only been a month, yet something already feels lost.  
      I miss the version of you who looked at me like I mattered.  
      I miss the version of us that felt connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t know where we’re headed.  
      Whether we’ll make it or quietly drift apart, I can’t say.  
      But thank you for the version of you that once stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still wish to see you on the next 24th.  
      And if that’s not written for us,  
      I hope we part gently, without wounds and regrets.
    </p>
    <p class="wish">
      May today treat you kindly,  
      and may peace visit your hear, even just for a little while.
    </p>

    <p class="sign">Xo, Delta</p>
