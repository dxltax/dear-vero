    <h1>My Dearest Vero,</h1>
    <p>
      Today marks a month since you became a part of my days.<br>
      I still remember how your smile melted my worries, how your presence brought calm to my chaos.<br><br>
      Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tonight, I want to celebrate this small, beautiful milestone with you.<br>
      Just you, me, and the way we laugh too hard about little things.
